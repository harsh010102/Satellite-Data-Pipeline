Typically, Strombolian activity is observed here, and sometimes phases of intense lava flow, creating high ash plumes and dangerous pyroclastic flows. As of today, October 10, 2023, explosive activity continues. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) in Washington has warned of a volcanic ash plume that has risen to an altitude of approximately 16,000 feet (4,900 meters) at 13:51 UTC.\n\nFollow us on social media:\nInstagram - shorturl.at/fkpZ9\nFacebook - shorturl.at/guBH2\nCreative Society - www.creativesociety.com"
